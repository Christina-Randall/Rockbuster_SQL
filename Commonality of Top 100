	COMMONALITY OF TOP 100
	
Note:	This is a query to see what films appeared in all three of our top ten queries. The result was zero so I changed the limit to 100 and we have three films as a result
	
	
Query	SELECT subquery.film_id
	FROM (
	  -- First subquery
	  SELECT f.film_id
	  FROM film AS f
	  WHERE f.film_id IN (
	    SELECT f2.film_id
	    FROM film AS f2
	    JOIN inventory AS i ON f2.film_id = i.film_id
	    JOIN rental AS r ON i.inventory_id = r.inventory_id
	    GROUP BY f2.film_id
	    ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
	    LIMIT 100
	  )
	
	  INTERSECT
	
	  -- Second subquery
	  SELECT f.film_id
	  FROM film AS f
	  WHERE f.film_id IN (

	    JOIN inventory AS i ON f2.film_id = i.film_id
	    JOIN rental AS r ON i.inventory_id = r.inventory_id
